This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to type hinting and potential integer overflow. The `foo` function correctly adds two integers. However, the `bar` function, which calls `foo` and multiplies the result by 2, may lead to an integer overflow if the sum of `$a` and `$b` is large enough to exceed PHP's integer limit. The solution addresses this using appropriate type handling and checks.
